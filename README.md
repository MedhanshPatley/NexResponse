# NexResponse
Developed a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for combining information retrieval and response
generation.
Implemented vector embeddings for input queries and documents, retrieving the top 5 most relevant contexts based
on cosine similarity.
Utilized EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B from Hugging Face as the large language model (LLM) for generating responses
based on retrieved contexts.
